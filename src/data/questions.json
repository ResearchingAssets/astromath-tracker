    "question": "A boy stands on top of a cliff of height h and throws a stone with speed v at an angle θ below the horizontal. Find the condition on θ such that the stone hits the ground with maximum possible speed.",
    "hint": "Use energy conservation or resolve velocity components.",
    "solution": "Maximum speed occurs when θ = 45°. The final speed is √(v² + 2gh) independent of θ — wait, no! Actually, kinetic energy is conserved in horizontal, but vertical gains 2gh. The maximum speed is when all initial KE + PE is converted back — it's when the stone is thrown straight down! But that contradicts... wait — actually for maximum speed on impact, throw straight down. But the question is tricky — the maximum speed occurs when cosθ = 0, i.e. θ = 90° downward. But let's think again...",
    "correctAnswer": "The speed is maximum when the stone is thrown vertically downward (θ = 90°). Final speed = v + √(2gh)"
